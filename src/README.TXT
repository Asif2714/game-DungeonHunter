Please complete this README file for your level 3 mini-project submission.

If your level 1/2 submission did not get full marks you MUST complete the second part of this template describing how and where your have improved your code so that it now meets the level 1 and 2 requirements. If your code still does not meet level 1 and 2 requirements then you will get 0 for level 3.

LEVEL THREE

Exceptions

[Created in AdventureGame Line 300, used in Line 138]
[I have made this as a textbased only game as I couldn't finish the GUI due to errors. Players have to enter yes/no in some cases and exception handlers do not allow anything else than that.]

Collections

[Collections used is ArrayList, used in Line 30 onwards, generated in method starting from line 208]
[Collection ArrayList is used in this program to flexibly generate a number of enemies, which could not be done by generating an Array of Enemies as it is of fixed length]

File I/O

[Once a game is complete, the user is asked if he/she wants to save the score at line 138, if yes, the players name along with the bounty the player collected is stored in a file named Scores.txt in a new line.]

'Something impressive'

[Strong use of java class hiearchy is used in this code along with scopes of easy maintainability. A hero cannot start fight with another hero as it only accepts fight with enemies.]


LEVELS 1 AND 2

(ONLY complete this if you did not get full marks for your level 1/2 submission.)

LEVEL ONE

[Briefly (three sentences) explain the changes you have made to your code so that it fully meets the level one requirements.]

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [Insert name of superclass here]

This superclass is extended into at least two subclasses called [Insert names of the subclasses here]

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

Subclass 2.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]


LEVEL TWO

[Briefly (three sentences) explain the changes you have made to your code so that it fully meets the level two requirements.]

Polymorphism consists of the use of the Substitution principle and Late Dynamic binding.

In my code, polymorphism is implemented in at least two placesâ€¦

Example 1.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class name and line number where substitution is used]. The name of the superclass used this example is [name of superclass] and the subclasses used are [names of subclasses].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why this example of polymorphism is necessary in your code.]

Example 2.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class name and line number where substitution is used]. The name of the superclass used this example is [name of superclass] and the subclasses used are [names of subclasses].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why this example of polymorphism is necessary in your code.]
